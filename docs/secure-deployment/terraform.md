# Terraform secure coding

Terraform scan is powered by tfsec which uses Hashicorp's AST library and checkov for improved analysis.

## Best practices

Currently, checks are mostly limited to AWS/Azure/GCP resources, but there are also checks which are provider agnostic.

| Rule   | Provider | Description                                                       |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |

| GEN002 | Generic  | Potentially sensitive data stored in local value.                 |
