# Introduction

ShiftLeft Scan is a free [open-source](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan) security tool for modern DevOps teams. With an integrated multi-scanner based design, ShiftLeft Scan can detect various kinds of security flaws in your application and infrastructure code in a single fast scan. The kind of flaws detected are:

* [x] Credentials Scanning to detect accidental secret leaks
* [x] Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) for a range of languages and frameworks
* [x] Open-source dependencies audit
* [x] Licence violation checks

!!! Summary
    Scan supports a range of integration options: from scanning the code on your IDE to scanning every build and pull-request in the CI/CD pipelines.

## Sample invocation

Easy one-liner command below:

```bash
sh <(curl https://slscan.sh)
```

The above command simply invokes the below docker run command.

```bash
docker run --rm -e "WORKSPACE=${PWD}" -v $PWD:/app shiftleft/sast-scan scan --build
```
