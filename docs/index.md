# Introduction

![scan-logo](images/scan-light.png)

Scan (sk√¶n) is a free [open-source](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan) security audit tool for modern DevOps teams. With an integrated multi-scanner based design, Scan can detect various kinds of security flaws in your application and infrastructure code in a single fast scan without the need for any _remote server_. The kind of flaws detected are:

* [x] Credentials Scanning to detect accidental secret leaks
* [x] Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) for a range of languages and frameworks
* [x] Open-source dependencies audit
* [x] Licence violation checks

!!! Workflow
    Scan is purpose built for DevSecOps workflow [integrations](integrations) with nifty features such as automatic build breaker, Pull Request summary comments, GitHub [Code scanning](integrations/code-scan.md) and [Bitbucket](integrations/bitbucket.md) Code Insights support and so on.

## Sample invocation

Easy one-liner command below (Assuming this is fine for you):

```bash
sh <(curl https://slscan.sh)
```

The above command simply invokes the below docker run command.

```bash
docker run --rm -e "WORKSPACE=${PWD}" -v $PWD:/app shiftleft/sast-scan scan --build
```

Scan is also available as an AppImage. Please download the latest version from GitHub [releases](https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan/releases) or use the one-liner command below.

```bash
sh <(curl https://slscan.sh/install)
```

Expanded version of the one-liner command.

```bash
wget https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/sast-scan/releases/download/v1.9.27/scan
chmod +x scan
./scan -t nodejs
```
