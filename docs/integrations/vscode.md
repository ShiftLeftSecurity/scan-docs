## Troubleshooting

- VS Code version should be 1.41.0 or higher for the extension to install and work
- The user should be part of the `docker` group on Linux and Mac. Please refer to the [post install](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/linux-postinstall/) steps for your platform. Example below for linux.

  ```bash
  sudo groupadd docker
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  ```

- Internet connectivity is required while loading the results for the first time. You might see the below error otherwise.
