## Integration with Jenkins

You can add the following stage to your `Jenkinsfile` (declarative syntax) for a very basic integrations.

```
stages {
    stage('ShiftLeft Scan') {
        agent {
            docker { image 'shiftleft/sast-scan' }
        }
        steps {
            sh 'scan'
        }
    }
}
```

For Java and JVM based projects, compile the project before invoking the scan.

```
stages {
    stage('ShiftLeft Scan') {
        agent {
            docker { image 'shiftleft/sast-scan' }
        }
        steps {
            sh 'scan --build'
        }
    }
}
```

We also recommend archiving artifacts generated by the scan for easy viewing using the [`archiveArtifacts`](https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/core/) step.
